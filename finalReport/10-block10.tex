\section{Block 10: Persistence - Stentiford}

The persistence stage consists of an infinite impulse response filter 
implemented very simply by taking weighted averages of the current 
image and the previous image. The resulting image is then saved to be 
used as the previous image in the next iteration. The relative weights 
of the current and previous image determine how much previous images 
stick around. A higher persistence, meaning more weight is given to the 
previous image, results in better temporal noise filtering but blurs 
moving objects, while the lower persistence more clearly displays moving 
objects and the expense of more noise grain in the image.
